In the Java API Documentation, I found the method inside the Rectangle class, that can 
set the x,y-coordinates of the rectangle, as well as, set the width and height of the 
rectangle aswell. The Rectangle class was a part of the jawa.awt package.
The name of the method was, "setBounds". This method was of type void (so it didn't
return anything, and it was public aswell). It took for parameters which were of type
integer. The four parameters were: int x, int y, int width, int height.
All in all, the method was written as:
public void setBounds(int x, int y, int width, int height).

For the setBounds method each of the parameters do the following:
int x -> sets the x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangle
int y -> sets the y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangle.
int width -> the width of the rectangle
int height -> the height of the rectangle
